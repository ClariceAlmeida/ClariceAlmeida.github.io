## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned more about the uses of flexbox which i was struggling the most, so it was a good practice.

also, when i submitted the first version i got feedbacks that really helped me understanding what was wrong and most important the reasons why was wrong.

### Continued development

My plan is to continue studing html and css improving my skills on this technologies and move on to the study of JavaScript in the next months.
